- The use of ""permuted block randomization"" and ""sealed opaque envelopes"" further supports the randomized controlled trial design, as these are methods used to ensure randomization.
- The study involves an intervention group and a control group, which is characteristic of a randomized controlled trial.
- The study is also longitudinal, as it follows participants over a period of 36 months to assess changes in physical activity, fitness, and well-being.
- The study is observational in nature as well, as it observes the effects of the intervention over time without manipulating variables beyond the intervention itself.","  - ""A total of 255 individuals (40% women) were included in this substudy, out of the main study population of 701, whereof 127 patients from the IG and 128 from the CG.""",,"- The total sample size is explicitly mentioned as 255 individuals.

- Gender distribution is given as 40% women, which implies 60% men, although the exact number of men is not directly stated.
- Initial physical activity status is detailed in terms of the Physical Activity Index (PAI) categories: inactive, low active, medium active, and high active.
- Specific population characteristics include employment status, education level, smoking status, presence of metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus.","  - ""The Hjerteløftet intervention programme is previously described [2] and is only briefly summarized here. Patients randomized to the intervention group (IG) participated in a 5-day hospital-based lifestyle course in a specialized cardiac rehabilitation hospital (CR Hospital) which focused on PA, nutrition, smoking cessation, stress-management, motivation and individual goal-setting.""
  - ""More specific regarding the exercise intervention, the aim during the course was to educate the patients about the benefits of exercise and the safety of exertion despite the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.""
  - ""Exercise sessions consisted of aerobic exercises, interval training, resistance training, aqua-aerobics and attention training.""
  - ""The purpose of the exercise-programme was to introduce the individuals to a wide spectrum of activities and sports to make it more likely they would find activities of interest which they would be able to continue in the future.""

  - ""Regarding exercise, both the type of activity, the frequency, intensity and the duration of the activity sessions during the follow-up period were decisions made by the patient.""",,"- The physical activity intervention was part of a 5-day hospital-based lifestyle course at a cardiac rehabilitation hospital.
- The intervention included various types of physical activities such as aerobic exercises, interval training, resistance training, aqua-aerobics, and attention training.
- The purpose was to introduce participants to a wide range of activities to encourage long-term engagement.
- Participants created their own exercise plans during the course, which were tailored to their lifestyle, motivation, and physical activity level.
- The intervention period was 3 years, with follow-up managed through primary care and digital options.
- The frequency and duration of activities during the follow-up period were determined by the patients themselves, indicating a flexible and self-directed approach.","  - ""During the course the patients made a graded exercise plan for the follow-up period themselves, supported by the study staff, tailored to the patient`s lifestyle, motivation and PA level.""

  - ""A major focus in the Hjerteløftet intervention programme was empowering the individuals in taking care of their health, through providing opportunities to develop mental and practical skills, including stress management.""
  - ""The purpose of the exercise-programme was to introduce the individuals to a wide spectrum of activities and sports to make it more likely they would find activities of interest which they would be able to continue in the future.""",,"- The motivation strategy appears to be positive, as the program focuses on empowering individuals and providing them with opportunities to develop mental and practical skills, which suggests a supportive and encouraging approach.
- The theoretical framework is not explicitly mentioned, but the emphasis on empowering individuals and developing mental and practical skills suggests elements of Self-Determination Theory, which focuses on autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
- The type of intervention support includes a structured program with a 5-day hospital-based lifestyle course, counseling through individual goal-setting and support from study staff, and referral to local physical activity opportunities.","  - ""The patients` experiences related to psychological wellbeing were assessed using the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), which is among the most widely used questionnaires assessing subjective psychological well-being""
  - ""The short questionnaire is reported to have adequate validity as an outcome measure in clinical trials.""
  - ""The questionnaire contains the following items (1) ""I have felt cheerful and in good spirits"", (2) ""I have felt calm and relaxed"", (3) ""I have felt active and vigorous"", (4) ""I woke up feeling fresh and rested"" and ( 5) ""My daily life has been filled with things that interest me"".""
  - ""The patient is asked to rate how well each of the statements applies to her or him when considering the last 14 days.""
  - ""Each of the 5 items is scored from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all the time) and a raw score therefore ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (maximal well-being).""
  - ""The raw score is multiplied with 4, translating the scale into a percentage scale from 0 (absent) to 100 (maximal).""
  - ""The WHO-5 score increased in both groups during follow-up""
  - ""The difference between mean change scores indicated a significant increase of 5.06, 95% CI: 0.68 to 9.45, p = 0.024, on intervention vs. control.""
  - ""When controlling for baseline imbalance using ANCOVA, the difference between the mean change scores of each treatment group was 3.28 and no longer significant (95%CI: 0.68 to 9.45, p = 0.104).""",,"- The paper uses the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to measure psychological well-being.
- The WHO-5 is a five-item questionnaire that assesses subjective psychological well-being by asking about feelings of cheerfulness, calmness, activity, freshness, and interest in daily life.
- Each item is scored from 0 to 5, and the raw score is then translated into a percentage scale from 0 to 100.
- The WHO-5 was administered at baseline and follow-up to assess changes in psychological well-being.
- The results showed a significant increase in WHO-5 scores in both groups, with a larger increase in the intervention group compared to the control group.
- The significant increase was reported with a mean difference of 5.06, but this became non-significant when controlling for baseline imbalance.","  - ""The 3-year follow-up period was allocated to primary care and included a periodic digital follow-up option from the hospital.""
  - ""Follow-up was based on each patient`s individual plan for achieving and maintaining risk factor control decided at the lifestyle course.""
  - ""The CG received care as usual in the community health care by the GP.""
  - ""A total of 255 individuals (40% women) were included in this substudy, out of the main study population of 701, whereof 127 patients from the IG and 128 from the CG.""
  - ""After randomization, 7 patients in the IG and 20 patients in the CG were lost to follow up.""
  - ""Finally, 228 (89.5%) patients remained in the follow-up study population, with 120 (95%) patients in the IG and 108 (84%) in the CG""
  - ""PA levels increased significantly more in the IG compared to the CG during follow-up.""
  - ""The difference between the mean change PAI scores was 1.07, 95% CI: 0.21 to 1.93, p = 0.015 on intervention vs usual care.""
  - ""The difference remained significant when controlling for baseline imbalance using ANCOVA; 0.90, 95% CI: 0.10 to 1.70, p = 0.028,""
  - ""There were no corresponding differences in cardiorespiratory fitness.""
  - ""The WHO-5 score increased in both groups during follow-up""
  - ""The difference between mean change scores indicated a significant increase of 5.06, 95% CI: 0.68 to 9.45, p = 0.024, on intervention vs. control.""
  - ""When controlling for baseline imbalance using ANCOVA, the difference between the mean change scores of each treatment group was 3.28 and no longer significant (95%CI: 0.68 to 9.45, p = 0.104).""
  - ""Only minor, nonsignificant changes were observed for traditional risk factors and cardiometabolic variables.""
  - ""The use of antihypertensive medication increased significantly more in the CG ( p = 0.044).""
  - ""A major finding in the present substudy of a primary prevention trial [2], was a statistically significant increased PA level in favour of the IG.""
  - ""The program also resulted in a within group significant decrease in the proportion of patients reporting being inactive in the IG, while the decrease was less prominent in the CG.""
  - ""In contrast, the records showed that there were no changes in CRF in either group during 3 years of follow-up, and no differences between groups.""
  - ""The true potential of lifestyle intervention regarding cardiovascular risk reducing effects cannot be expected to be realized in a study like the current one, as the intervention was not tightly controlled, the inclusion did not require any high commitment of the patients, and follow-up was to a large degree left to the patient and the primary care health system, already being short on resources.""
  - ""A more intense and shorter intervention period would most likely result in larger effects of the parameters explored in the present substudy, but the generalization of the findings to public health efforts would then be more questionable.""
  - ""Our study also has some limitations. Due to the nature of the intervention, neither the study staff nor the patients were blinded for the treatment. This may have contributed to both performance and detection bias as knowledge about treatment allocation might have influenced both health care providers and the patients` behaviour.""
  - ""The CG also performed a one-day assessment at baseline and at follow-up in the CR Hospital, including the CPET. The follow-up and the study focus on PA, fitness and lifestyle may have motivated patients in the CG and thereby reduced the between-group difference in exercise and other favourable lifestyle changes.""
  - ""A limitation of the study is also the risk of attrition bias. The overall loss to follow-up was 10.6%, which may be expected in a lifestyle study with a follow-up time as long as 3 years.""
  - ""The difference in drop-out rates between groups, however, with more dropouts in the CG (20/128, 15.6%) than in the IG (7/127, 5.5%), may relate to that the patients wanted to participate in the study because of motivation for lifestyle change and consequently may have been disappointed when allocated to usual care.""
  - ""Another limitation of the study was the large number of invalid accelerometer-registrations. The findings regarding PA must be considered with some caution, as analyses on changes between baseline and follow-up are based on self-reports only, and confirmation through objective measurements were hampered.""
  - ""It should also be noted that we have limited knowledge of the adherence and the time course of the intervention effects in this study, as no interim evaluations were carried out between baseline and 3 years of follow-up.""
  - ""Although in-between measurements could have added interesting knowledge regarding patients` behaviour, this was not prioritized. As the main aim of the study was to assess the effects of the intervention programme on total cardiovascular risk after 3 years, interim assessments were not considered pivotal, and omitted because of resource considerations.""","  - ""(Page 6, Table 1) Table 1: Baseline variables\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Baseline variables                     | Total sample (n = 255) | Intervention (n = 127) | Control (n = 128) |""
