  - ""Changes in measures of psychological well-being between baseline and intervention are illustrated in Table 3""",,"- The paper uses several measurement tools to assess mental well-being outcomes, including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) for mood, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) for depressive symptoms, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) for depression, anxiety, and stress, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale for self-esteem, Multidimensional Body Self-Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MSRQ-AS) for body image satisfaction, and RAND Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) for mental and physical health.
- These tools were used at two time points: baseline (week 0) and the end of the intervention (week 12).
- The range of possible scores for each tool is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but it is known that BDI-II scores range from 0 to 63, DASS-21 scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale, and SF-36 scores are transformed into T-scores.
- The source and validation of these measurement tools are well-established in psychological research literature.","  - ""Ninety-nine mildly hypertensive participants aged 40–65 years were enrolled in a four-week LPD washout period and then randomised to either an LPD or an HPD for eight weeks.""

  - ""There was a significant between-group difference (p = 0.01) in change in depressive symptoms as assessed with BDI-II, but no other significant effects were found between groups with regards to depression, anxiety or stress measured using the DASS-21 or positive and negative affect measured with PANAS.""
  - ""There were statistically significant between-group differences in change in different component scores (general health (p = 0.03) and energy/fatigue (p = 0.02)) and the overall summary scores for the physical health component (p = 0.04) and mental health component (p = 0.01), with more positive changes demonstrated in the HPD group.""
  - ""In the HPD group, a 66.6% reduction in BDI-II score was observed after the intervention.""
  - ""The primary outcome of the PPhIT study was to identify whether high consumption of F&V, berries and dark chocolate could improve microvascular function in hypertensive subjects [30].""
  - ""the improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation might have also resulted in improvements in depressed mood.""
  - ""the results from the present RCT trial showed heterogeneous findings regarding the effect of a polyphenol-rich dietary pattern on aspects of psychological well-being, with positive effects demonstrated on depressive symptoms and both the physical and mental health status components of the SF-36 quality of life measure.""",,"- The study involved a four-week washout period followed by an eight-week intervention period. This suggests that any observable changes in mental well-being would occur within the eight-week intervention period.
- The paper reports a significant decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in the high polyphenol diet (HPD) group compared to the low polyphenol diet (LPD) group. This indicates an improvement in mental well-being.
- The magnitude of improvement is quantified as a 66.6% reduction in BDI-II scores in the HPD group.
- Statistical significance is noted for changes in depressive symptoms (p = 0.01) and for improvements in physical and mental health components of the SF-36 (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01, respectively).
- The study does not provide specific timeframes within the eight-week intervention period when these improvements were observed, only that they were measured at the end of the intervention."
