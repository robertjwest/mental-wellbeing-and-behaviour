This indicates that consumption change was assessed through self-reported data.
- The AUDIT score is a standardized questionnaire used to assess alcohol consumption patterns and problems.
- The time frame for measuring consumption change was from baseline to six months follow-up.
- The study does not explicitly define categories of consumption change like quitters, initiators, or persistent drinkers. Instead, it focuses on changes in AUDIT scores and reported consumption over time.

  - ""There is, therefore, value in encouraging people considering a month of abstinence to at least register on the Dry January website, and to emphasise the benefits to physical health, psychological well-being, and self-efficacy (Yeomans, 2019).""
  - ""There was support for the third hypothesis: along with more moderate alcohol use, being male, and having greater DRSE related to emotional relief, greater use of email support was a significant independent multivariate predictor of successfully completing Dry January.""

  - ""However, people also appear to need external support.""
  - ""The results reported here concur with other studies of abstinence from alcohol and other behaviours: the content on campaign websites and the sense of community that they foster may boost and maintain participants' motivation (Pennay et al., 2018;Smith et al., 2015;Yeomans, 2019).""
  - ""The results presented here suggest that there is value in encouraging people who are considering a month of abstinence in January to register on the Dry January website, so that they may receive the benefits of the support that is offered, rather than hoping that they will undertake it (and complete it) ""unofficially"".""
  - ""There is also a need to ensure that the support offered to participants is perceived as relevant and that it is helpful.""
  - ""Although making greater use of email support provided by the organisers of Dry January was a significant independent predictor of the likelihood of completing the abstinence challenge, the possibility of ""reverse causation"" cannot be ruled out: people who drank alcohol before the end of Dry January may have stopped reading emails.""
  - ""However, this is unlikely to be the only explanation, because the data in Table 2 show that 62% of people who read none of the emails still managed to complete Dry January.""
  - ""Given that successful completion of Dry January was associated with larger increases in DRSE and mental wellbeing, there is a need to encourage more people to use the support provided, and for the support provided to be as useful as possible, so that more people can experience the benefits of successful completion of a dry month.""
  - ""Qualitative research could be helpful for exploring the most effective and appealing message content, framing, and medium of delivery.""
  - ""The analyses presented here focused on the sub-sample of the population that opted in to attempt Dry January.""
  - ""Comparison of Dry January participants to a ""control"" group would allow analyses of the extent to which the changes observed are unique to Dry January participants, and the likelihood that they are caused by participation in Dry January.""
  - ""Although the data presented here cannot provide definitive proof that the observed changes were caused by Dry January, it is notable that people who completed Dry January had larger improvements in WEMWBS and GSE scores and broader well-being than did people who did not complete it.""
  - ""Such differences would be hard to explain by referring to variables that affected the whole population.""
  - ""Although this study provides valuable insights into correlates and consequences of completion of a month of abstinence from alcohol, it does have some limitations.""
  - ""The first is that Dry January registrants are self-selected and may not be representative of the general population.""
