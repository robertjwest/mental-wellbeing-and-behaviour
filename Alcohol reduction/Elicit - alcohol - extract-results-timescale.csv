- The method of tracking alcohol consumption changes involves calculating the reduction in WHO drinking risk levels from baseline to the last month of treatment.
- The specific metrics used include the number of standard drinks consumed and the conversion to grams of pure alcohol, which are then categorized into WHO drinking risk levels.
