Instead, it focuses on alcohol consumption metrics (alcohol-free days) rather than validated well-being instruments.",yes,The study is explicitly stated as a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).,yes,The follow-up periods (3 and 12 months) fall within the 24 hours to 6 months criterion.,yes,"Participants were ""heavy drinkers"" from companies, not those with diagnosed alcohol use disorder (though some clinic patients were diagnosed as alcohol dependent).",yes,"The study examines alcohol reduction through Brief Intervention (BI) in isolation, with clear control groups.",yes,This is a longitudinal study with measurements at multiple time points.,Exclude,"The study meets most screening criteria, including appropriate study design, intervention isolation, and population type. However, it critically fails to measure well-being or life satisfaction using validated instruments, which disqualifies it from meeting the core outcome measurement requirement. Uncertainty also exists regarding participant age ranges, further complicating potential inclusion.",0.9
Temporary Setback or Lasting Challenge? The Impact of Transient and Persistent Functional disability on later life well-being.,"Thibault Kohler, B.

It focuses on functional disability and its impact on well-being.,yes,The study is longitudinal and measures effects over time.,Exclude,"The study fundamentally does not meet key screening criteria, particularly those related to alcohol reduction, as it focuses on functional disability and well-being in aging populations. While the research demonstrates methodological rigor with validated instruments and a longitudinal design, it completely diverges from the specified intervention and population parameters.
