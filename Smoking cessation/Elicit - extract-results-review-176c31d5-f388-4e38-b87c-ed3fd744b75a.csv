  - ""Using a large, representative sample of older US adults who responded to a survey in 2006 and 2010, we evaluated the longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between PWB and cigarette use via cross-lagged analysis.""",,"- The paper uses the Satisfaction with Life Scale to measure life satisfaction, which is a specific instrument for assessing psychological well-being.
- The Satisfaction with Life Scale includes items like ""In most ways my life is close to ideal,"" and scores are averaged across five items, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.
- The scale's reliability is supported by a Cronbach's alpha ranging from .79 to .89 and test-retest reliability from .83 after two weeks to .54 after four years.
- The study examines the longitudinal relationship between psychological well-being (PWB) and smoking status over a four-year period (2006 to 2010).
- Key numerical results include standardized path coefficients: life satisfaction in 2006 predicted a reduced likelihood of smoking in 2010 with a coefficient of -0.04, and smoking in 2006 predicted lower life satisfaction in 2010 with a coefficient of -0.25.
- The study's findings suggest that greater life satisfaction, optimism, and positive affect in 2006 are associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking in 2010, while smoking in 2006 is associated with lower PWB in 2010.
- The study uses structural equation modeling to analyze the data, controlling for sociodemographic covariates like gender, race, age, and education.","  - ""Greater life satisfaction (standardized path coefficient = -0.04), optimism (standardized path coefficient = -0.07), and positive affect (standardized path coefficient = -0.08) in 2006 predicted a reduced likelihood of smoking in 2010.""
  - ""Being a smoker in 2006 predicted lower life satisfaction (standardized path coefficient = -0.25), optimism (standardized path coefficient = -0.10), positive affect (standardized path coefficient = -0.10), and purpose in life (standardized path coefficient = -0.13) in 2010.""
  - ""The analysis tested the hypothesis that greater PWB in 2006 would be associated with not smoking in 2010 and that smoking in 2006 would be associated with lower PWB in 2010.""
  - ""The models supported this hypothesis for all but one path.""
  - ""Specifically, though there was no association between purpose in life in 2006 and smoking status in 2010, greater life satisfaction, optimism, and positive affect measured in 2006 were each predictive of a reduced likelihood of smoking in 2010.""
  - ""In all models, smoking in 2006 was associated with less PWB in 2010.""

This suggests that these psychological well-being (PWB) measures can predict smoking cessation.
- Conversely, being a smoker in 2006 was associated with lower levels of life satisfaction, optimism, positive affect, and purpose in life in 2010, indicating that smoking may negatively impact PWB.
- The study used standardized path coefficients to measure these associations, which are statistically significant as indicated by the asterisks in the tables.
- The findings suggest that increasing PWB may promote smoking cessation and that smoking may inhibit PWB, which are key findings related to the association between stopping smoking and life satisfaction or wellbeing.
