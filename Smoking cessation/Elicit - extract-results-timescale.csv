- Specifically, it states that those who achieved abstinence were ""19% less likely to screen positive for psychological distress"" at 6 months post-discharge. This indicates an improvement in mental well-being.
- The use of the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) as a screening tool for psychological distress suggests that mental health was assessed.
- The adjusted relative risk (aRR) for psychological distress is provided with a confidence interval (95% CI 0.68–0.93), indicating a statistically significant reduction in psychological distress among those who quit smoking.
- The abstract also mentions that results were similar when assessed as a function of self-reported cessation, suggesting consistency in the findings regardless of the method of cessation confirmation."

This is indicated by the odds ratios provided, which show a significant reduction in depression-related outcomes for both short-term and long-term ex-smokers.
- There was no significant change in anxiety measures for the general population or those with a history of anxiety, suggesting that smoking cessation does not exacerbate anxiety.
- The study highlights that smoking cessation may lead to a reduced incidence of depression, as evidenced by lower odds ratios for depression prescriptions and symptoms among ex-smokers compared to current smokers.
- The tables referenced provide additional statistical data supporting these findings, including odds ratios and confidence intervals that indicate significant differences between smokers and ex-smokers.
- The study also notes a significant decrease in prescriptions for mental health problems among ex-smokers, further supporting the idea that smoking cessation is associated with improved mental well-being."
